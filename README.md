creating a dog door remote that will do things such as open and close, etc.
It open (saying “The dog door is open.”) and close (saying “The dog door is closed.”).  
It take into account a dog going outside and coming back in; it should open when the dog barks, recognize the sound of the owner’s dog and not other dogs, not let other dogs are animals in by closing when necessary (use Timer),
Some people may want their dog door to lock/unlock all the windows in the house if a certain combination on a keypad is put in.  Some people may want the door to detect the dog scratching the door.
